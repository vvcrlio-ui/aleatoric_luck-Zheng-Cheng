# Zheng & Cheng Replication

This module uses the processed NLSY79 analysis tables produced by the authors'
public OSF source package. It has two distinct purposes:

1. `overall_prediction.py` reproduces the cumulative Aset1/Aset2/Bset1/Bset2
   comparison with a 70/30 split and source seed `12345`.
2. The feature-count, domain, SHAP, and sample-size scripts are extensions.
   They should not be described as analyses contained in the Zheng-Cheng paper.

The error-floor parameter from the sample-size extension is conditional on the
data, predictor space, model family, split, and power-law extrapolation. It is
not a model-independent estimate of Bayes error or literal "luck."

This is a Python structural replication, not a byte-for-byte reproduction of
the original R/Stata workflow. R's `set.seed(12345)` and Python's
`random_state=12345` do not generate identical train/test row assignments.

## Data

Data are not committed. The tracked `data` path is a symlink to the shared
cluster data directory:

```text
/gpfs3/users/mills/tej036/aleatoric-luck/data
```

The expected files are:

- `asample1_noincomelag.csv`
- `asample2_withlag.csv`
- `asample3_nosei.csv`

The default scripts use `data/asample2_withlag.csv` and `Cm_lhourlywage`.

## Environment

Python 3.11 is recommended:

```bash
cd Zheng_Cheng_Replication
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For Colab, use `requirements-notebook.txt` and `colab_run.ipynb`.

## Source-aligned cumulative comparison

```bash
python src/overall_prediction.py \
  --models ols ridge lasso xgboost bart
```

XGBoost uses `max_depth=2`, `eta=0.3`, and five-fold CV to choose up to 90
boosting rounds. Ridge and Lasso also select penalties using five-fold CV.
BART uses the paper's 200 trees, 1,000 recorded iterations, and 100 burn-in
iterations by default. BART jobs use process-based parallelism because
BartPy's random-number generator is process-global.

## Extensions

```bash
python src/feature_sets.py --models xgboost ridge lasso
python src/domain_wise.py --models xgboost ridge lasso
python src/sample_size.py --models xgboost ridge lasso
python src/SHAP_vals.py
python src/SHAP_experiment.py
```

Long-running scripts checkpoint CSV results after each batch and resume
successful jobs from an existing output file. Failed model fits are recorded
with `status=failed` instead of discarding the whole run.

Each checkpoint row includes an `experiment_id`, outcome, data hash, split, and
other identifying metadata. Reusing an output path with a different experiment
does not skip work or overwrite the earlier experiment. Checkpoints created
before this metadata was introduced must be removed or passed under a new
`--out` path before resuming.

Output columns distinguish standard `r2_test_mean_baseline` from the paper's
`r2_train_mean_baseline`. In sample-size experiments, the latter uses the mean
of the actual training subset for each draw.

Power-law fits use non-negative bounds, bootstrap intervals, and stability
diagnostics. The bootstrap interval remains conditional on the fixed train/test
sample; it does not capture population sampling or holdout uncertainty.

## SLURM

The scripts in `slurm/` use job arrays, contain no user-specific cluster path,
and write one output per model. Submit them from `Zheng_Cheng_Replication/`;
the tracked `logs/` directory lets Slurm open stdout and stderr before the
script starts. `VENV` defaults to `$PROJECT_DIR/.venv`, matching the
environment setup above.

```bash
export PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/aleatoric_luck-Zheng-Cheng/Zheng_Cheng_Replication
export VENV=/path/to/your/venv
export PYTHON_MODULE=Python/3.11
sbatch slurm/run_overall.sbatch
sbatch slurm/run_sample_size_light.sbatch
sbatch slurm/run_sample_size_bart.sbatch
```

`run_sample_size_light.sbatch` arrays over the non-BART models with the same
resources as the other extension scripts. `run_sample_size_bart.sbatch` runs
BART alone, with more memory and deliberately low concurrency, because it is
far heavier than the other models.

Adjust time, memory, partition, account, and module names for the target
cluster. Merge model-specific CSVs only after all array tasks finish.

## Colab

Open `colab_run.ipynb`. It clones the public repository, mounts Google Drive
for data only, installs the minimal notebook requirements, and runs smoke-sized
commands by default.
